# About
`firetail` is a tui tool designed to filter and view your Opnsense firewall logs with ease, It's still in development, but it already offers key features for efficient log analysis.

Key features include:
- **Interactive viewing**: Use simple keybindings for efficient navigation.
- **Real-time log viewing**: Optionally view logs directly from the firewall.
  
With `firetail`, you can quickly parse and interact with firewall logs, ensuring you stay on top of your network security.

```
Show logs filtered by the `vlan0.20` interface.

firetail -i vlan0.20,vlan0.10 --dst-ip 192.168.40.10 filter_20250102.log
```
Show logs filtered by the `vlan0.20` and `vlan0.10` interfaces, and the destination IP `192.168.40.10`.
